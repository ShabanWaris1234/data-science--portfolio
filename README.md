# Data Science Portfolio
Within this repository, you'll find a collection of data science projects presented in Jupyter notebooks and Python files. These projects reflect my academic, self-learning, and hobby endeavours in data science. These works showcase the depths of data exploration, machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and data visualization techniques.
